# Food Recipe Website
- A website where I keep my .NET up to date as well as learning about new skills such as React or implement new secure ways such as Okta authorization for logins/registers
- Implemented MongoDB due to the availability and scalability
- Will host on AWS after finishing some required functionalities of the websites
- Will be updated regularly during my free time
- This is a hobby project to make sure I'm still familiar with back-end development while learning about embedded development on microcontrollers
