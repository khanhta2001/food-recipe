- Based on the Final Project that I developed in Python Flask, this project didn't use microservices, which created a lot of trouble when I tried to update any part of the codes
- I'm currently converting to .NET in order to learn more about it as well as developing as a distributed system, which allows more scalability
- Besides that, I'm going to integrate MongoDB SQL Database in here then deploy it in AWS
- This is a hobby project, where i use to keep my back-end as well as front-end skill up-to-date (mainly in .NET). I'm also familiar with PHP and Python web framework.
