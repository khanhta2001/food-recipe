# Food Recipe Website
- Based on the Final Project that I developed in Python Flask, this project didn't use microservices, which created a lot of trouble when I tried to update any part of the codes
- I'm currently converting to .NET in order to learn more about it as well as developing as a distributed system, which allows more scalability
- Besides that, I'm going to integrate Azure SQL Database in here then deploy it in AWS
- Because a lot of the features of .NET are still new to me (especially security and deployment in AWS), I expect this to have a lot of bugs and non-functional for a long time
